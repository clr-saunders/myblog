    "section": "What is a Hypothesis Test?",
    "text": "What is a Hypothesis Test?\nA hypothesis is a claim about the world, and a hypothesis test is a method to determine if it holds (Lourenzutti et al. 2025). For example, a data scientist working for a Vancouver Tourism company might hypothesize that the average wait time for pizza delivery in Vancouver is less than 30 minutes. To test this claim, pizza delivery wait times are observed around Vancouver using careful data sampling methods to ensure the observations are unbiased and representative of the true average. Then, the scientists conducting the study propose two important hypotheses called the null and the alternative (Lourenzutti et al. 2025). The alternative is the hypothesis that the test seeks to establish evidence for, i.e., that the average wait time is less than 30 minutes. And, the null hypothesis represents the way that the world would be if the alternative hypothesis were not true. So, in the pizza delivery example, the null hypothesis claims that the average wait time in Vancouver is greater than or equal to 30 minutes.\nTo test if there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis, scientists conduct calculations under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, and quantify how likely the observed data is under that assumption (Lourenzutti et al. 2025). If it is extremely unlikely that one would collect the data in a world where the null hypothesis holds, then one can reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative! Within the context of the pizza example, the hypothesis test framework assumes the true average wait time for pizza delivery in Vancouver is greater than or equal to 30 minutes. Then, calculations are performed on the sampled observations of pizza delivery wait times around Vancouver to quantify the likelihood of observing those wait times in a world where the true average is greater than or equal to 30 minutes. If it’s significantly unlikely, the hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis that the average wait time for pizza delivery in Vancouver is less than 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Visual representation of the null and alternative hypotheses for average pizza delivery time in Vancouver.\nNote. Image generated using ChatGPT (DALL·E) by OpenAI (OpenAI 2026b).\n\n\n\nNotice that the successful hypothesis test doesn’t conclude that the alternative hypothesis is the true state of the world, rather it rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. This means that scientific results are not actually proving a claim to be indisputably true but rather finding that we have strong evidence to conclude that a hypothesis is more likely than another! Therefore, science is an ongoing process of discovery and rejecting previous ideas in favour of new ideas, and as we improve studies and examine new evidence the accepted scientific truth of yesterday is rejected in favour of the accepted scientific truth of today."

    "text": "If scientific results are susceptible to change, why believe them?\nOne might wonder, if the hypothesis framework can validate conflicting results over time, does that diminish the trustworthiness of all the results? After all, what good is it to find that the average pizza delivery time in Vancouver is less than 30 minutes if someone else will find out it is greater than 30 minutes tomorrow? Well, there are two concerns here, one is the trustworthiness of the scientist executing the hypothesis test, the other is the trustworthiness of the hypothesis test framework itself. Regarding the former - the scientific community expects hypothesis tests to be rigorous, and well documented such that the test can be repeated with the same results (Diaba-Nuhoho and Amponsah-Offeh 2021). And published scientific results ought to be validated through a stringent process of peer review to ensure that the scientific method is properly executed and results are trustworthy (Diaba-Nuhoho and Amponsah-Offeh 2021). Of course, scientists are capable of errors, and of course there are false claims that purport to be scientific - but just as you cannot judge all sheep by a wolf in sheep’s clothing, the validity of the scientific method cannot be judged by veracity of non-scientific results. The point is, the scientific community has built in methods and protections to maintain the robust standards of the scientific method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow to identify whether or not a scientific result is in fact rigorous and reliable is a whole other discussion (and an increasingly important one, in the saturated online world)."

If a sample is well representative of the population, having sufficient evidence in your sample to reject a null hypothesis in favour of an alternative hypothesis is a significant result. To help illustrate why, I will return to the pizza example. Looking again at Figure 3, you can imagine that the left and right panels are two different worlds, orange world and green world. In orange world, the average pizza delivery time is actually 60 minutes, and in green world it is 15 minutes. Intuitively, if you collect a sample of 500 pizza delivery wait times from orange world, you can expect the average wait time of the sample will be around 60 minutes. Of course, there will be some variation - sometimes there might be unusual traffic, or no traffic at all resulting in larger or smaller than average wait times. But overall, with a large enough sample size the average of the observed pizza delivery times will be close to the average for orange world. Similarly with green world! The scientists conducting the hypothesis test do not know whether the real world is the orange world, or the green world (or another world altogether), and so they collect a sample of observations and examine them. Then, they assume the world is the orange world (a world where the average pizza delivery time is greater than 30 minutes), and calculate the probability of collecting their sampled observations in the orange world. I previously outlined that if it’s significantly unlikely, the hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis. Here the notion of significance actually refers to a very low probability threshold. A typical hypothesis test considers a probability under 5% to be significant - so to reject the null hypothesis (that pizza delivery is greater than 30 minutes), it needs to be the case that the collected sample is less than 5% likely in the orange world - less than 5%! Some hypothesis tests use an even more stringent threshold of 1%, or less."

When the headline says “Red Wine is good for your heart!”- dig into the article and find out what specific claim was tested, because there must be a hypothesis tested at some significance level, on some specific population. It is very likely that the apparently conflicting headlines are from studies with different hypotheses. They may not have examined the same population, or exactly the same research question, or they may have used different methods. So, while both headlines may appear to represent science disagreeing with itself - both studies may have found a unique and specific significant result. Additionally, with the hypothesis framework in mind, we can expect to see change in scientific results over time, as we reject previous ideas in favour of new ideas, improve studies and examine new evidence!"
