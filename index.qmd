### Is Science Just Guessing? 


A hypothesis test is central to establishing scientific discoveries. However, when one scrolls through social media and reads a headline like “Red wine is good for your heart”, the specific mechanics of how the results were established may not be considered. But without an appreciation for the scientific method, it might seem very suspicious when later on you read a headline like "Red wine increases the risk of heart disease!", and you may begin to wonder whether science is just a strange guessing game.

### Two Headlines, Opposite Findings?

Trust in science as a paradigm for truth predicts attitudes towards scientific issues - such as following health orders during a worldwide pandemic, or engaging in climate action [@peng2022give]. So, a lack of trust in the scientific method can have real consequences. In this article, I demystify a central component of the scientific method, the hypothesis test. I demonstrate that the hypothesis test framework explains the possibility of conflicting headlines without diminishing the significance of scientific discovery.

### What is a Hypothesis Test? 

A hypothesis is a claim about the world, and a hypothesis test is a method to determine if it holds [@lourenzutti2025hypothesis]. For example, a data scientist working for a Vancouver Tourism company might hypothesize that the average wait time for pizza delivery in Vancouver is less than 30 minutes. To test this claim, pizza delivery wait times are observed around Vancouver using careful data sampling methods to ensure the observations are unbiased and representative of the true average. Then, the scientists conducting the study propose two important hypotheses called the null and the alternative [@lourenzutti2025hypothesis]. The alternative is the hypothesis that the test seeks to establish evidence for, i.e., that the average wait time is less than 30 minutes. And, the null hypothesis represents the way that the world would be if the alternative hypothesis were not true. So, in the pizza delivery example, the null hypothesis claims the average wait time is greater than or equal to 30 minutes. The hypothesis test framework assumes that the null hypothesis is true, and quantifies how likely the observed data is under that assumption [@lourenzutti2025hypothesis]. If it is extremely unlikely that one would collect that data in a world where the null hypothesis holds, then one can reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative!

Notice that the successful hypothesis test doesn’t conclude that the alternative hypothesis is the true state of the world, rather it rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. This means that scientific discoveries are not actually proving something to be true but rather finding that we have strong evidence to conclude that a hypothesis is more likely than another! Therefore, science is an ongoing process of discovery and rejecting previous ideas in favour of new ideas, and as we improve studies and examine new evidence the accepted scientific truth of yesterday is rejected in favour of the accepted scientific truth of today!

### Doesn't that mean science is still guessing?
