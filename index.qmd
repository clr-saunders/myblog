## Is Science Just Guessing? 

A hypothesis test is central to establishing scientific discoveries. However, when one scrolls through social media and reads a headline like “Red wine is good for your heart”, the specific mechanics of how the results were established may not be considered. But, without an appreciation for the scientific method, it might seem very suspicious when later on you read a headline like "Red wine increases the risk of heart disease!", and you may begin to wonder whether science is just a strange guessing game. Trust in science as a paradigm for truth predicts attitudes towards scientific issues - such as following health orders during a worldwide pandemic, or engaging in climate action [@peng2022give]. So, a lack of trust in the scientific method can have real consequences. In this article, I demystify a central component of the scientific method, the hypothesis test. I demonstrate that the hypothesis test framework explains the possibility of conflicting headlines without diminishing the significance of scientific discovery.

### Two Headlines, Opposite Findings?

## What is a Hypothesis Test? 

A hypothesis is a claim about the world, and a hypothesis test is a method to determine if it holds [@lourenzutti2025hypothesis]. For example, a data scientist working for a Vancouver Tourism company might hypothesize that the average wait time for pizza delivery in Vancouver is less than 30 minutes. To test this claim, pizza delivery wait times are observed around Vancouver using careful data sampling methods to ensure the observations are unbiased and representative of the true average. Then, the scientists conducting the study propose two important hypotheses called the null and the alternative [@lourenzutti2025hypothesis]. The alternative is the hypothesis that the test seeks to establish evidence for, i.e., that the average wait time is less than 30 minutes. And, the null hypothesis represents the way that the world would be if the alternative hypothesis were not true. So, in the pizza delivery example, the null hypothesis claims that the average wait time in Vancouver is greater than or equal to 30 minutes. 


To test if there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis, scientists conduct calculations under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, and quantify how likely the observed data is under that assumption [@lourenzutti2025hypothesis]. If it is extremely unlikely that one would collect the data in a world where the null hypothesis holds, then one can reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative! Within the context of the pizza example, the hypothesis test framework assumes the true average wait time for pizza delivery in Vancouver is greater than or equal to 30 minutes. Then, calculations are performed on the sampled observations of pizza delivery wait times around Vancouver to quantify the likelihood of observing those wait times in a world where the true average is greater than or equal to 30 minutes. If it's significantly unlikely, the hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis that the average wait time for pizza delivery in Vancouver is less than 30 minutes.

Notice that the successful hypothesis test doesn’t conclude that the alternative hypothesis is the true state of the world, rather it rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. This means that scientific results are not actually proving a claim to be indisputably true but rather finding that we have strong evidence to conclude that a hypothesis is more likely than another! Therefore, science is an ongoing process of discovery and rejecting previous ideas in favour of new ideas, and as we improve studies and examine new evidence the accepted scientific truth of yesterday is rejected in favour of the accepted scientific truth of today.

## If results can change, why believe them? 

One might wonder, if the hypothesis framework can validate conflicting results over time, does that mean the results aren't trustworthy? After all, what does it mean to find that the average pizza delivery time in Vancouver is less than 30 minutes if someone else will find out it is greater than 30 minutes tomorrow? Well, there are two concerns here, one is the trustworthiness of the scientist executing the hypothesis test, the other is the trustworthiness of the hypothesis test framework itself. Regarding the former - the scientific community expects hypothesis tests to be rigorous, and well documented such that the test can be repeated with the same results [@Diaba-Nuhoho2021reproducibility]. And published scientific results ought to be validated through a stringent process of peer review to ensure that the scientific method is properly executed and results are trustworthy [@Diaba-Nuhoho2021reproducibility]. Of course, scientists are capable of errors, and of course there are false claims that purport to be scientific - but just as you cannot judge all sheep by a wolf in sheep's clothing, the validity of the scientific method cannot be judged by veracity of non-scientific results. The point is, the scientific community has built in methods and protections to maintain the robust standards of the scientific method.

How to identify whether or not a scientific result is in fact rigorous and reliable is a whole other discussion (and an increasingly important one, in the saturated online world).

## The Significance of Results

Second, with regard to the trustworthiness of the hypothesis test framework itself - the result of a hypothesis test is not trivial. If a sample is well representative of the population, having sufficient evidence in your sample to reject a null hypothesis in favour of an alternative hypothesis is a significant result. To help illustrate why, I will return to the pizza example. Imagine that the left and right panels in @fig-hypotheses refer to two different worlds, Orange World and Green World. In Orange World, the average pizza delivery time is 60 minutes, and in Green World it is 15 minutes. Intuitively, if you collect a sample of 500 pizza delivery wait times from Orange World, you can expect the average wait time of the sample will be around 60 minutes. Of course, there will be some variation - there may be terrible traffic, or a lot of new delivery driver's resulting in larger than average wait times. Or, there could be no traffic at all, and shorter than average wait times. But overall, with a large enough sample size the average of the observed pizza delivery times will be close to 60 minutes - the true Orange World average. Similarly with Green World, the sample average will be close to 15 minutes - the Green World average.

When conducting a hypothesis test, scientists do not know whether they live in the orange world, or the green world (or another world altogether), and so they observe pizza delivery times. Then, under the null hypothesis, they assume the world is the Orange World, and calculate the probability of collecting their sampled observations. I previously outlined that if it's *significantly* unlikely, the hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis. Here the notion of significance actually refers to a very low probability threshold. A typical hypothesis test considers a probability under 5% to be significant - so to reject the null hypothesis (that pizza delivery is greater than 30 minutes), it needs to be the case that the collected sample is less than 5% likely in the orange world - less than 5%! Some hypothesis tests use an even more stringent threshold of 1%, or less. 

## Now, back to conflicting headlines...

Now, with the hypothesis test framework demystified, we can contextualize a headline as a broad simplification of a much more complex and qualified scientific result. When the headline says "Red Wine is good for your heart!"- dig into the article and find out what specific claim was tested, because there must be a hypothesis tested at some significance level, on some specific population.  It is very likely that the apparently conflicting headlines are from studies with different hypotheses. They may not have examined the same population, or exactly the same research question, or they may have used different methods. So, while both headlines may appear to represent science disagreeing with itself -  both studies may have found a unique and specific significant result. Additionally, with the hypothesis framework in mind, we can expect to see change in scientific results over time, as we reject previous ideas in favour of new ideas, improve studies and examine new evidence!
